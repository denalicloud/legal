## Servers maintenance and software updates

Where it is possible (scheduled maintenance), the customer is advised from client’s area (network issues menu). Where, instead, it’s necessary to execute an urgent maintenance procedure, our technical staff will be required to go ahead fastest possible and without any wait. The customer is also aware that there are parts of services that do not depend directly on Denali, for example datacenter connectivity, broken hardware items etc, since different suppliers are normally involved in all the process. In case of any malfunction due to connected suppliers, Denali will do its best to coordinate the work of suppliers involved, in order to get them to resolve as soon as possible. Denali carries no liability in such events.
