# UPTIME POLICY

## General

 This Uptime policy is a policy governing the use and reachability of the DENALI Services listed below and applies separately to each Customer using these DENALI Services. This policy is accepted by customer by activating any class of DENALI services.

 DENALI will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that each class of Service identified is "Available" during a given calendar month at 99% time or more. 

### Calculation of Availability

 "Monthly Availability Percentage" is calculated by subtracting from 100% the percentage of minutes during the month in which any class of DENALI Service was Unavailable. Monthly Availability Percentage measurements exclude Unavailability resulting directly or indirectly from any Unavailability Exclusion (as defined below).

### Unavailable

 A class of DENALI Services will be considered "Unavailable" or in state of "Unavailability" when a class of DENALI Services has no external connectivity.

### Unavailability Exclusions

 The following (each an "Unavailability Exclusion") will be excluded from any time-based calculations related to a class of DENALI Service being Unavailable:

 - Scheduled, recurring or zero impact maintenance windows;
 - Unavailability due to customer's misuse of a particular class of DENALI Service;
 - Unavailability that results from customer's facilities, equipment, software or other technology and/or third party facilities, equipment, services, software or other technology (other than third party equipment within DENALI’s direct control);
 - Unavailability arising from customer's use of an outdated release of the DENALI Services or third party software, or any failure to install a material Update to either of the foregoing;
 - Unavailability caused by third party service or facility providers, including any telecom, internet, or other related service or facility provider, or packet loss, network or Internet problems beyond DENALI’s border router supporting DENALI’s public internet connectivity;
 - Denial of service attacks, virus or hacking attacks, or bugs in code, hardware, or services for which there is no commercially reasonable, known solution (even if there is a known workaround); and
 - Force majeure events or any other event that are not within DENALI’s direct control or that could not have been avoided with commercially reasonable care.

 DENALI will use its best efforts to communicate downtime events (by the network status facility of customer's control panel) prior to scheduled, recurring, or zero impact maintenance windows as described above, however, this will not always be possible. 

 Without limiting the foregoing, service interruptions due to emergency maintenance will constitute Unavailability Exclusions equivalent to scheduled maintenance windows.
