# Datacenter protecting the environment

 Denali relies on European data centres where nature and the environment are respected. Energy is produced from renewable and ecological sources, which are used to power the servers and all connected equipment.

 In this way Denali wants to make its contribution to nature and the environment, favouring this type of source over others.

 In particular, in the data centre in Germany, electricity produced from water is used. the partner is  Energiedienst AG, a TÃœV certified company that generates green energy from 100 percent carbon dioxide-free and environmentally-friendly hydropower. 

 The hardware used on the physical servers is also kept up to date in order to use the best and most efficient technology available on the market.
